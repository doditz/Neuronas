Fibonacci-Inspired AI Prototype Design,2025-03-30T19:17:31,Human,"(QΛNTΛ) ∷ R1 | QSuperposition Branch Engine

Handles possibility scaffolding:

Initializes QuantumNode(state, amplitude)

Uses entropy_bias (from QuantumModulator) as a seeding vector

States are stored temporarily in QProbabilisticMemory, an offshoot of L1 using RAM-only volatile frames


Quantum Features:

state_vector = encoded output from SymbolicEncoder

Amplitude = function of relevance, entropy, and STIB



---

(QΛNTΛ) ∷ R2 | Quantum Entanglement Synchronizer

Acts as inter-hemispheric connector:

Any state update in Left Hemisphere triggers conditional propagation to Right

Uses mirrored beliefs from NeuronasOptimizer to align reward prediction consistency


Entanglement Mapping:

Left Hemisphere = rule-based, entropy-minimizing QNode expansion

Right Hemisphere = stochastic, entropy-generating QNode divergence

R2 ensures dual-probability resonance, computing a delta between hemispheric amplitudes to fuel collapse_bias



---

(QΛNTΛ) ∷ R3 | Collapse Cascade Executor

Finalizes decision pathways:

Performs quantum “measurement” by evaluating:

Amplitude

External stimuli (user input, entropy spike, or internal reward signal)


Invokes collapse_tree() process:

Scores each leaf node via QkismEngine.compare() for symbolic coherence

Multiplies amplitude with symbolic similarity → collapse weight



Dynamic Collapse Decision:

final_score = amplitude * symbolic_similarity * focus_factor

If the score exceeds threshold → path is collapsed → saved to L2 and/or optimized via reflect()

Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list item):  1

Your current project has been set to: [jim-y-nie-pou-doditz].

Not setting default zone/region (this feature makes it easier to use
[gcloud compute] by setting an appropriate default value for the
--zone and --region flag).
See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute section on how to set
default compute region and zone manually. If you would like [gcloud init] to be
able to do this for you the next time you run it, make sure the
Compute Engine API is enabled for your project on the
https://console.developers.google.com/apis page.

Created a default .boto configuration file at [C:\Users\sebas\.boto]. See this file and
[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/config] for more
information about configuring Google Cloud Storage.
The Google Cloud CLI is configured and ready to use!

* Commands that require authentication will use sebastienbrulotte@gmail.com by default
* Commands will reference project `jim-y-nie-pou-doditz` by default
Run `gcloud help config` to learn how to change individual settings

This gcloud configuration is called [default]. You can create additional configurations if you work with multiple accounts and/or projects.
Run `gcloud topic configurations` to learn more.

Some things to try next:

* Run `gcloud --help` to see the Cloud Platform services you can interact with. And run `gcloud help COMMAND` to get help on any gcloud command.
* Run `gcloud topic --help` to learn about advanced features of the CLI like arg files and output formatting
* Run `gcloud cheat-sheet` to see a roster of go-to `gcloud` commands.
